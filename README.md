# Improved Configuration Load

## Description
Replaces the simple dropdown to load stations, ships, or loadouts with a bigger and more feature-rich dialog.

* Wider dialog: allowing for displaying of much longer names without cutting off.
* Groups: Organize your presets by including a delimiter character in the name, which this new dialog will use create a pseudo folder structure. You can thereby organize stations by mods, factions, production type, or whatever you like.
* Search: Quickly find what you're looking for by typing part of it's name.
* Production module filter: Filter stations by what production modules are included.
* Ship race filter: Now you can easily find the boron ships in your long list of blueprints.
* Disable mod by menu: Don't like the new dialog for a specific menu (station plans, module loadout, ship loadout)? You can disable them individually.
