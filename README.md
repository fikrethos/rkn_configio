# Improved Configuration Load

## Description
Replaces the simple dropdown to load stations or loadouts with a bigger and more feature-rich dialog.

* Wider dialog: allowing for displaying of much longer names without cutting off.
* Folders: Organise your presets by including a delimiter character in the name, which this new dialog will use create a folder structure. You can thereby organize stations by mods, factions, production type, etc.
* Search: Filter your presets by a search string, allowing you to quickly find what you are looking for.
* Production module filter: Filter stations by what production modules are included.

## Requirements

* SirNuke's Mod Support API [[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2042901274) | [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/503)]

## Compatibility

This mod is save compatible. You can add it to an existing save, and remove it without errors.

This mod is NOT compatible with other mods that changes the station or ship designer UI (I am unaware of any mod that does).
