# Improved Station Load

## Description
Replaces the simple dropdown to load station stations with a bigger and more feature-rich dialog.

* Wider dialog: allowing for displaying of much longer names without cutting off.
* Folders: Organise your stations by including a delimiter character in the name, which this new dialog will use create a folder structure. You can thereby organize stations by mods, factions, production type, etc.
* Search: Filter your stations by a search string, allowing you to quickly find what you are looking for.
* Production module filter: Filter stations by what production modules are included.
